						<p>
							The Fullbackers, established in 1993, was created to provide support and aid to the
							football programs at Black River High School as well as the Middle School.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Fullbackers membership include parents, former players, alumni, parents of alumni,
							coaches (past and present), and other respected members of the Black River community. Our
							current membership is committed to help provide the best for the young men the participate
							in the Black River football program. Since establishment, the Fullbackers have contributed over
							<b>$400,000</b> to the football program.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our intention is to provide additional funding  and support to the football program, which
							is the most expensive sports program to field. This funding helps to provide:
							<ol>
								<li>
									The safest program possible.
								</li>
								<li>
									The opportunity for young athletes to participate in the program without
									excessive fees.
								</li>
								<li>
									The opportunity for adults in the community 
									to work together and grow as giving adults
								</li>
							</ol>
